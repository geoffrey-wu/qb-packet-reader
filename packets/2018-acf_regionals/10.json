Klaus von Klitzing first discovered the quantum Hall effect by exposing one of these devices to a magnetic field. The quadratic model for these devices accounts for the body effect by predicting that I-sub-D varies with voltage squared. The simplest model for length modulation in these devices was developed by Shichman and Hodges, in analogy with the Early effect. In these devices, the inversion layer behaves analogously to a capacitor above the threshold voltage. These devices, the ideal form of which can achieve zero current in the cutoff regime, work by modulating the size of the channel between the source and drain by applying a voltage across the gate.
