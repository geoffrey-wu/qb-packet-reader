That \u201cabsolute\u201d value of this quantity is divided by water column height to give its so-called (*) \u201cpotential\u201d form, which is conserved by fluid parcels as the result of Kelvin\u2019s theorem. By Stokes\u2019 theorem, the integral of this quantity around a loop gives the enclosed circulation.
